=head1 NAME

ValueType - A role to create Value Type classes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use ValueType;

  class Point does ValueType {
      has $.x = 0;
      has $.y = 0;
  }

  say Point.new.WHICH;  # Point|Int|0|Int|0

  # fill a bag with random Points
  my $bag = bag (^1000).map: {
    Point.new: x => (-10..10).roll, y => (-10..10).roll
  }
  say $bag.elems;  # less than 1000

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The ValueType role mixes the logic of creating a proper ValueType into a
class.  A class is considered to be a value type if the C<.WHICH> method
returns an object of the C<ValueObjAt> class: that then indicates that
objects that return the same C<WHICH> value, are in fact identical and
can be used interchangeably.

This is specifically important when using set operators (such as C<(elem)>,
or C<Set>s, C<Bag>s or C<Mix>es, or any other functionality that is based
on the C<===> operator functionality, such as C<unique> and C<squish>.

The format of the value that is being returned by C<WHICH> is only valid
during a run of a process.  So it should B<not> be stored in any permanent
medium.

=head1 THEORY OF OPERATION

The first time the C<WHICH> method (mixed in by this role) is called, it
will check all of its attribute values for being a value type.  If they
all are, then it will construct a C<ValueObjAt> object for its C<WHICH>
value, save it for future reference, and return it.  If any of the attribute
values are B<not> a value type, then an exception will be thrown.
